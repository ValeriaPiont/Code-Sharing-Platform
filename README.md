# Code Sharing Platform
JetBrains Academy. Project: [Code Sharing Platform](https://hyperskill.org/projects/130?track=12).

## About
There is a lot of collaboration in programming: many projects require sharing your code with other developers. 
Using open web resources such as Pastebin is not always an option. In this project, I created my own simple 
version of a code-sharing platform.
